title: Welcome to my digital garden!
---

I know it's a bit empty in here. Like all gardens, it will start with a small plant/flower and will take much time to reach full blossom. I know that it's not a one-time project that I can finish off by pulling some all-nighters. So, I'll tend to it regularly, trying to grow it slowly. I hope I'm able to make it what it deserves to be. Thanks for stopping by :)
